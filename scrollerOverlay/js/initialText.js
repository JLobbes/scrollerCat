    Hi, I made this tool to help me read. Maybe it will help you as well.
        
    Press the play button above (↑↑↑↑) to start/stop auto-scroll or just tap the screen to pause.

    To paste your text here, press the paste icon above and paste into the box. 
    Then jam the curved arrow.

    Swipe left or right to scroll through the text. You can click with a mouse or punch 
    arrow keys on the keyboard as well. 

    Below, you can press the settings button to change scroll speed, fontSize and more.

    When you change settings, they are saved on your browser's local storage. 
    No data is transmitted or stored anywhere else on the web.
    If you clear your browser history, your settings will be cleared too. 

    You can click and drag toolbar icons to re-order how you like. If you drag the divider,
    all icons left of the divider will be pinned.

    Scroll back to back to the beginning or press refresh to read this again.


    If you have any feedback, please do reach out. Happy reading!
